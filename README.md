## 1. Project Description
In this project, we use a Chest X-Ray dataset and we identify images where an "effusion" is present. This is a classification problem, where we will be dealing with two classes - 'effusion' and 'nofinding'. Here, the latter represents a "normal" X-ray image.
## 2. Data Description
Our data is in the form of grayscale (black and white) images of chest x-rays. You can download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/shaitender/cxr-dataset
